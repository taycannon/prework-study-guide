# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This my prework study guide webpage that I developed for the first time. This a guide/cheatsheet to go back to if I get stuck about something.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
